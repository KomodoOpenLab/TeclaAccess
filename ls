[31m-                Preamble[m
[31m-[m
[31m-  The licenses for most software are designed to take away your[m
[31m-freedom to share and change it.  By contrast, the GNU General Public[m
[31m-License is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free[m
[31m-software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.  This[m
[31m-General Public License applies to most of the Free Software[m
[31m-Foundation's software and to any other program whose authors commit to[m
[31m-using it.  (Some other Free Software Foundation software is covered by[m
[31m-the GNU Lesser General Public License instead.)  You can apply it to[m
[31m-your programs, too.[m
[31m-[m
[31m-  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not[m
[31m-price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you[m
[31m-have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for[m
[31m-this service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it[m
[31m-if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it[m
[31m-in new free programs; and that you know you can do these things.[m
[31m-[m
[31m-  To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid[m
[31m-anyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights.[m
[31m-These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you[m
[31m-distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.[m
[31m-[m
[31m-  For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether[m
[31m-gratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that[m
[31m-you have.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the[m
[31m-source code.  And you must show them these terms so they know their[m
[31m-rights.[m
[31m-[m
[31m-  We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and[m
[31m-(2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy,[m
[31m-distribute and/or modify the software.[m
[31m-[m
[31m-  Also, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make certain[m
[31m-that everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free[m
[31m-software.  If the software is modified by someone else and passed on, we[m
[31m-want its recipients to know that what they have is not the original, so[m
[31m-that any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original[m
[31m-authors' reputations.[m
[31m-[m
[31m-  Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software[m
[31m-patents.  We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free[m
[31m-program will individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the[m
[31m-program proprietary.  To prevent this, we have made it clear that any[m
[31m-patent must be licensed for everyone's free use or not licensed at all.[m
[31m-[m
[31m-  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and[m

[31m-[m
[31m-            GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE[m
[31m-   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION[m
[31m-[m
[31m-  0. This License applies to any program or other work which contains[m
[31m-a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed[m
[31m-under the terms of this General Public License.  The "Program", below,[m
[31m-refers to any such program or work, and a "work based on the Program"[m
[31m-means either the Program or any derivative work under copyright law:[m
[31m-that is to say, a work containing the Program or a portion of it,[m
[31m-either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated into another[m
[31m-language.  (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in[m
[31m-the term "modification".)  Each licensee is addressed as "you".[m
[31m-[m
[31m-Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not[m
[31m-covered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of[m
[31m-running the Program is not restricted, and the output from the Program[m
[31m-is covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the[m
[31m-Program (independent of having been made by running the Program).[m
[31m-Whether that is true depends on what the Program does.[m
[31m-[m
[31m-  1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's[m
[31m-source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you[m
[31m-conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate[m
[31m-copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the[m
[31m-notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any warranty;[m
[31m-and give any other recipients of the Program a copy of this License[m
[31m-along with the Program.[m
[31m-[m
[31m-You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and[m
[31m-you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.[m
[31m-[m
[31m-  2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion[m
[31m-of it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and[m
[31m-distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1[m
[31m-above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:[m
[31m-[m
[31m-    a) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices[m
[31m-    stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.[m
[31m-[m
[31m-    b) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in[m
[31m-    whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program or any[m
[31m-    part thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third[m
[31m-    parties under the terms of this License.[m
[31m-[m
[31m-    c) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively[m
[31m-    when run, you must cause it, when started running for such[m
[31m-    interactive use in the most ordinary way, to print or display an[m
[31m-    announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and a[m
[31m-    notice that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you provide[m
[31m-    a warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under[m
[31m-    these conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of this[m
[31m-    License.  (Exception: if the Program itself is interactive but[m
[31m-    does not normally print such an announcement, your work based on[m
[31m-    the Program is not required to print an announcement.)[m
[31m-[m
[31m-These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If[m
[31m-identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Program,[m
[31m-and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in[m
[31m-themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those[m
[31m-sections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you[m
[31m-distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based[m
[31m-on the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of[m
[31m-this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the[m
[31m-entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.[m
[31m-[m
[31m-Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest[m
[31m-your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to[m
[31m-exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or[m
[31m-collective works based on the Program.[m
[31m-[m
[31m-In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program[m
[31m-with the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of[m
[31m-a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under[m
[31m-the scope of this License.[m
[31m-[m
[31m-  3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it,[m
[31m-under Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of[m
[31m-Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:[m
[31m-[m
[31m-    a) Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable[m
[31m-    source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections[m
[31m-    1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,[m
[31m-[m
[31m-    b) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three[m
[31m-    years, to give any third party, for a charge no more than your[m
[31m-    cost of physically performing source distribution, a complete[m
[31m-    machine-readable copy of the corresponding source code, to be[m
[31m-    distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium[m
[31m-    customarily used for software interchange; or,[m
[31m-[m
[31m-    c) Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer[m
[31m-    to distribute corresponding source code.  (This alternative is[m
[31m-    allowed only for noncommercial distribution and only if you[m
[31m-    received the program in object code or executable form with such[m
[31m-    an offer, in accord with Subsection b above.)[m
[31m-[m
[31m-The source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for[m
[31m-making modifications to it.  For an executable work, complete source[m
[31m-code means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any[m
[31m-associated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to[m
[31m-control compilation and installation of the executable.  However, as a[m
[31m-special exception, the source code distributed need not include[m
[31m-anything that is normally distributed (in either source or binary[m
[31m-form) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the[m
[31m-operating system on which the executable runs, unless that component[m
[31m-itself accompanies the executable.[m
[31m-[m
[31m-If distribution of executable or object code is made by offering[m
[31m-access to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent[m
[31m-access to copy the source code from the same place counts as[m
[31m-distribution of the source code, even though third parties are not[m
[31m-compelled to copy the source along with the object code.[m
[31m-[m
[31m-  4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program[m
[31m-except as expressly provided under this License.  Any attempt[m
[31m-otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is[m
[31m-void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License.[m
[31m-However, parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under[m
[31m-this License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such[m
[31m-parties remain in full compliance.[m
[31m-[m
[31m-  5. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not[m
[31m-signed it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or[m
[31m-distribute the Program or its derivative works.  These actions are[m
[31m-prohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by[m
[31m-modifying or distributing the Program (or any work based on the[m
[31m-Program), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and[m
[31m-all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying[m
[31m-the Program or works based on it.[m
[31m-[m
[31m-  6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the[m
[31m-Program), the recipient automatically receives a license from the[m
[31m-original licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to[m
[31m-these terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further[m
[31m-restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.[m
[31m-You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to[m
[31m-this License.[m
[31m-[m
[31m-  7. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent[m
[31m-infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),[m
[31m-conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or[m
[31m-otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not[m
[31m-excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot[m
[31m-distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this[m
[31m-License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you[m
[31m-may not distribute the Program at all.  For example, if a patent[m
[31m-license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Program by[m
[31m-all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then[m
[31m-the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to[m
[31m-refrain entirely from distribution of the Program.[m
[31m-[m
[31m-If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under[m
[31m-any particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to[m
[31m-apply and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other[m
[31m-circumstances.[m
[31m-[m
[31m-It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any[m
[31m-patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any[m
[31m-such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the[m
[31m-integrity of the free software distribution system, which is[m
[31m-implemented by public license practices.  Many people have made[m
[31m-generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed[m
[31m-through that system in reliance on consistent application of that[m
[31m-system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing[m
[31m-to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot[m
[31m-impose that choice.[m
[31m-[m
[31m-This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to[m
[31m-be a consequence of the rest of this License.[m
[31m-[m
[31m-  8. If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in[m
[31m-certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the[m
[31m-original copyright holder who places the Program under this License[m
[31m-may add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding[m
[31m-those countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among[m
[31m-countries not thus excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates[m
[31m-the limitation as if written in the body of this License.[m
[31m-[m
[31m-  9. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions[m
[31m-of the General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions will[m
[31m-be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to[m
[31m-address new problems or concerns.[m
[31m-[m
[31m-Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Program[m
[31m-specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and "any[m
[31m-later version", you have the option of following the terms and conditions[m
[31m-either of that version or of any later version published by the Free[m
[31m-Software Foundation.  If the Program does not specify a version number of[m
[31m-this License, you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software[m
[31m-Foundation.[m
[31m-[m
[31m-  10. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free[m
[31m-programs whose distribution conditions are different, write to the author[m
[31m-to ask for permission.  For software which is copyrighted by the Free[m
[31m-Software Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes[m
[31m-make exceptions for this.  Our decision will be guided by the two goals[m
[31m-of preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free software and[m
[31m-of promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.[m
[31m-[m
[31m-                NO WARRANTY[m
[31m-[m
[31m-  11. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY[m
[31m-FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN[m
[31m-OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES[m
[31m-PROVIDE THE PROGRAM "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED[m
[31m-OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF[m
[31m-MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS[m
[31m-TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE[m
[31m-PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING,[m
[31m-REPAIR OR CORRECTION.[m
[31m-[m
[31m-  12. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING[m
[31m-WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR[m
[31m-REDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES,[m
[31m-INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING[m
[31m-OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED[m
[31m-TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY[m
[31m-YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER[m
[31m-PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE[m
[31m-POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.[m
[31m-[m
[31m-             END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS[m
[31m-[m
[31m-        How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs[m
[31m-[m
[31m-  If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest[m
[31m-possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it[m
[31m-free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.[m
[31m-[m
[31m-  To do so, attach the following notices to the program.  It is safest[m
[31m-to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively[m
[31m-convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least[m
[31m-the "copyright" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.[m
