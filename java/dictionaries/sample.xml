<!-- This is a sample wordlist that can be converted to a binary dictionary
     for use by the Latin IME.
     The format of the word list is a flat list of word entries.
     Each entry has a frequency between 255 and 0.
     Highest frequency words get more weight in the prediction algorithm.
     You can capitalize words that must always be capitalized, such as "January".
     You can have a capitalized and a non-capitalized word as separate entries,
     such as "robin" and "Robin".
